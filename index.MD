## **Professional Self-Assessment**
The coursework for the Bachelor's of Computer Science at Southern New Hampshire University has both introducted me to many concepts and best practices but also improved and refined by skills. My favorite classes were CS 340 (MongoDB Database with Python Dashboard), DAD 220 (MySQL Database), CS 330 (OpenGL Graphical Programming), and CS 370 (Machine Learning with Tensorflow). With my improved skills, I am very confident in my ability to write code that conforms to industry standards and best practices. 

#### Team Environments
As I took this degree online, proper and prompt communication with classmates and instructors was paramount to my success. I am active in the Unoffical Student Discord and have helped many other students and even a few classmates with assignments and professional inquiries. Managing repositories with multiple coders also showed me the importance of aligned goals and good CI/CD practices.


#### Communicating to Stakeholders
Communicating with other developers is only 1 facet of Computer Science. Often, the most important ability is the ability to properly break down complicated concepts so that non-technical people can understand them. With the Project Mangement class, I got a first-hand look into this process for the professional world. 

#### Data Structures and Algorithms
Many of the backbone classes for this degree focused on Data Structures and Algorithms and for good reason. Lack of knowledge in these areas results in faulty, slow, error-prone, or horribly optimized vode. I particularly like Hash Maps as I keep finding more good uses for them. Understanding how all of these Data Structures work allows me to choose the right one needed for a particular task or goal.


#### Software Engineering and Databases
Many of my favorite classes involve Databases and a front-end solution for them. I am comfortable with both SQL and MongoDB structures and creating CRUD modules for them. I even used aggregation pipelines heavily and even indexing. I can see myself working quite heavily with Databases in the future.

#### Security
Cybersecurity is my passion. When working on and coding these projects for school, I always like to think like an attacker and see if I can find any vulnerabilities within the code itself. Often times, better security results in a worse user experience and worse performance. The true answer is always a balance between security and usability.

## **Enhancement 1 and 2: Software Engineering and Design and Algorithms and Data Structures**

[Here is the repo.](https://github.com/SBlanchardCyberSec/BattleshipPyGameProject)

This Enhancement is taking a BattleShip clone that I wrote in Java and porting it to Python and adding new features such as a GUI and an AI player and fixing bugs. It uses Pygame Community Edition as a library and boasts an improved game loop, a responsive Graphical User Interface, and an AI player with a clear lose condition. 
Update: I have improved the AI significantly, it now targets adjacent cells after a successful hit and even changes strategy again after a 2nd adjacent hit. I have also improved the error handling and cleaned up some duplicate code in the Render function.

## **Enhancement 3: Databases**

[Here is the repo.](https://github.com/SBlanchardCyberSec/CS-499-Database-Enhancement)

This Enhancement took my Python Dashboard from CS 340 and fixes a few bugs and scaling issues. I also ported the dashboard from a Jupyter Notebook to a Python file for easier portability. I also removed the hard-coded credentials from the code and used environment variables instead. Finally, I also removed the hardcoded credentials from the codebase and use system environment variables instead for better security.
